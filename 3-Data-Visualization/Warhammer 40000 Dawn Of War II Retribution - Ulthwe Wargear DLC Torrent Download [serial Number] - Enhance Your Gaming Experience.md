> "I love this DLC. It adds some much needed variety and flavor to my Eldar heroes. The new wargear items are very powerful and fun to use. The Farseer's armor makes her more durable and lets her use her abilities more often. The Warlock's armor makes him more dodgy and gives him more energy. The new models and colors are also very nice, they make my Eldar look more like Ulthwe craftworlders. I think this DLC is worth every penny."
